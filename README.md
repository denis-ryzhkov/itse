Introduction To Software Engineering
====================================

Several people asked and will ask to teach them to code.

I am going to build here an introduction to software engineering,  
to help starting quickly and in right direction.

Coding vs Software Engineering
------------------------------

Coding (reading and writing the code) is an important part,  
but it is just a part of Software Engineering.

Processes
---------

Here is a flow of processes I use to create a software:

* Getting or generating an idea.
* Negotiating requirements.
* Learning new technologies.
* Analyzing task definition and proposing how to improve it.
* Planning architecture and details.
* Documenting.
* Implementing and testing.
* Reviewing and refactoring.
* Deploying and demonstrating.
* Measuring performance and feedback.
* Optimizing.

Principles
----------

What ideas I selected to follow:

* Value for user.
    * Sometimes I make solutions too beautiful inside, so reminding myself the main goal "Value for user" is helpful.
* DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.
    * "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".
    * Design principle I use by default for everything. Aware it should not be over-used to avoid breaking KISS.
* KISS - Keep it simple.
    * Adding complexity is simple. Making simple solution may be complex.
    * "most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex".

You will read books and select what principles to follow.

Teach vs Learn
--------------

The best advice I can give to anyone looking for a teacher in software engineering is:  
"Learn to learn by yourself".

And here is how:
* Select a technology to start with. See "First Quest" below.
* Ask google for links to original documentation.
* Almost any technology has at least one "Getting started" guide, tutorials and eventually reference for everyday use.
    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
    * https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html
    * etc.
* http://stackoverflow.com/ and other communities have answers to most questions you got wrong from the docs. Just google your question.
* Experiment! Try what will happen.
* Yes, direct answer from someone you know can save lots of your time, but it should be emergency fallback, not starting point, because in this case:
    * You waste time of the teacher.
    * You miss related experience you could run into while searching for answer by yourself.
    * You don't train your learning muscle.
    * You follow only one existing opinion instead of a chance to build your own opinion and to invent something beautiful.

First Quest
-----------

* Find "developer tools/console" in a menu of your desktop browser. Ask google to help you if needed.
* Type `alert('Hi')` there and press Enter.
